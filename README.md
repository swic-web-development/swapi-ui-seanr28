# SWAPI UI

You're familiar with:

1. The fundamentals of JS
2. Fetching data asynchronously
3. SWAPI
4. Buiding a UI around real data using:
     - function components
     - a data store
     - actions to dispatch updates to the UI
     - Tailwind CSS ðŸ’„
5. Fundamentals of 'prompt engineering' to leverage AI ðŸ¤– productively.
  
Now, it's your turn to put this all together and build your choice of a UI using [SWAPI.](https://swapi.tech/)

At the very least, you need to make a data request, parse the data as JSON and dispatch an action to update your UI to show off that data. Basically what you saw in the [TMDB demo.](https://github.com/swic-web-development/app-tmdb)
